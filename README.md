# Java Simple Calculator

Welcome to the Java Simple Calculator repository! This repository contains a concise Java program that demonstrates the implementation of a basic calculator functionality.

## Description

In this program, we have a `Calculator` class with a method `add` that performs addition of two numbers. The `add` method takes two integer parameters and returns their sum. The `Practice` class showcases how to use the `add` method to add two numbers.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
5. Run the compiled program using the command:
6. You will see the result of the addition printed to the console.

## Method Used

The `add` method in the `Calculator` class is used to perform addition of two numbers. It takes two integer parameters (`n1` and `n2`) and returns their sum (`r`). This method provides a simple and efficient way to perform addition operations.
